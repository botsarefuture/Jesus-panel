### **Explanation of Key Files and Directories:**

- **`app/__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask app, extensions, and blueprints.
- **`app/config.py`**: Contains configuration settings for the app.
- **`app/models.py`**: Defines database models using an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy).
- **`app/routes/`**: Contains route handlers, organized by feature.
- **`app/services/`**: Contains business logic and external integrations.
- **`app/utils/`**: Contains utility functions and helper modules.
